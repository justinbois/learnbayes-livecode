# Learning Bayesian Statistics Webinar

In this webinar we will perform an analysis on a simple, but deceptively tricky, data set. As we work through the analysis, we will

- Emphasize the importance of domain knowledge
- Learn about the "bet the farm" approach to choosing priors.
- Learn tips and tricks for keeping analyses organized.
- Demonstrate some tools I used (some of which I developed) in Bayesian analyses.

To follow along on your own machine, you can clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/justinbois/learnbayes-livecode.git`) or [download it](https://github.com/justinbois/learnbayes-livecode/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to follow along. Be sure to set up your machine following the instructions in the [setup.ipynb](https://github.com/justinbois/learnbayes-livecode/blob/main/setup.ipynb) notebook. You will need to have a functioning [Stan installation](https://mc-stan.org/), among a few other packages.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com). You can launch the notebooks from the following links.

- [Part I](https://colab.research.google.com/github/justinbois/learnbayes-livecode/blob/main/catastrophe_1.ipynb)
- [Part II](https://colab.research.google.com/github/justinbois/learnbayes-livecode/blob/main/catastrophe_2.ipynb)
- [Part III](https://colab.research.google.com/github/justinbois/learnbayes-livecode/blob/main/catastrophe_3.ipynb)

Note that if you view the notebooks on the GitHub website, the graphics will not appear. This is because I use Bokeh for the graphics, and this is not supported in the GitHub web viewer (as of August 2023).
